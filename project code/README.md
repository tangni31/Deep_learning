# Codes for T15's project Image Super-resolution
----


## Dataset: [CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)   

Note: You should download `Align&Cropped Images`.
  
## Modules: 
- [x] DCGAN Module: `DCGAN.py`     
- [x] Image procseeing module: `image_processing.py`  
- [x] training module: `train.py`  
- [x] test module: included in `main.py`        
- [x] coordination module: `main.py`      

## Requirements:  

To run it, you need install `python3` with `Tensorflow`, `numpy` and `scipy`.  

## Run：

- Put all CelebA Dataset images in `/dataset`  
- Put your own test images in `/test_img`        
        ```Note: All test images should be 178*218 and face should be in the image center (same as images in the 
        CelebA Dataset). There are some sample test images in /test_img. The model takes one batch_size of images as input to generate test results and the test_result.png will randomly show 10(defualt) of them. So, if your test images is less than a batch_size, there will be some duplicated results.```    
      
- Defualt training time is 240 minutes, you can change it in `train.py`  
- To train the model run: `python main.py train`  
- To use your own image to test the model run: `python main.py test`   
- Intermediate results are saved in `/train`   

## Trained model

We've uploaded our pertrained model on google drive. To use it, you need to download `checkpoint.zip`, unzip it and put all files in `/checkpoint`  
Download trained model:  [Trained Model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J3UmAzygZTWp40mhS3los5NNJS8aky6Y)  

## Training:

training module  
  
![training](https://github.com/tangni31/tensorflow/blob/master/project%20code/training.png?raw=true)   
During training, it will show the progress,  remaining training time, batch number, genertor and discriminator's loses.
It will save the intermediate result for every 200(defualt) batches and save the checkpoint for every 10,000(defualt) batches.  

## Testing:  
![testing](https://github.com/tangni31/deeplearning/blob/master/project%20code/testing.png?raw=true)  
During training, it will first restore model from `/checkpoint`, and load images in `/test_img`, finally, the result will be stored into `/test_img`.
  
## Sample intermediate result:  

This model will randomly choose 1 batch size images(defualt 16 images) in CelebA Dataset as test images to generate intermediate results. Intermediate results only shows 8(defualt) of them.

## Test results (test images were downloaded from google.com):

This model was trained on a GTX1080Ti for 4 hours, approximately 70,000 batches.
