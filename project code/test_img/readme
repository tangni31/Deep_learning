put your own test images here, make sure number of images = batch size,(default 16)

for example: if you choose batch size = 16 when you train your model, you should put 16 images here, all test images should be 178*218 
and face should be in the middle of the image (same as images in the CelebA Dataset).

The test_image will randomly show the results of 10 images in all test images.
